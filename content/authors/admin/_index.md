His honours project is titled, "Is Gaze-Cuing More Like Endogenous or Exogenous Orienting?"

In the Fall of 2022, Nicholas will join the Masters in Psychiatry Research program at Dalhousie University. Under the supervision of Dr. Sandra Meier and Dr. JianLi Wang, Nicholas will study the effects of social media use on mental health in youth.
